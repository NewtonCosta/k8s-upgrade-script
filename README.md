# Upgrading K8s Control Plane and Workers via Bash Sript

> ### Before begin upgrade:
> - Make sure you read the release notes carefully.
> - The cluster should use a static control plane and etcd pods or external etcd.
> - Make sure to back up any important components, such as app-level state stored in a database.
> _kubeadm upgrade does not touch your workloads, only components internal to Kubernetes, but backups are always a best practice._
> - [Swap must be disabled](https://serverfault.com/questions/684771/best-way-to-disable-swap-in-linux)
> - It's recommended to determine which version to upgrade to, check the procedure [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubeadm/kubeadm-upgrade/#determine-which-version-to-upgrade-to)

> **To perform upgrade to k8 control plane, this script follow these steps:**
>  1. Drain the control plane node
>  2. Upgrade Kubeadm on the contol plane node
>  3. Plan the upgrade (kubeadm upgrade plan)
>  4. Apply the upgrade (kubeadm upgrade apply)
>  5. Upgrade kubelet and kubectl on the control node
>  6. Uncordon the control plane node

### _Example: upgrading k8s control plane to latest stable 1.20 version_

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Upgrading K8s Control plane to latest stable 1.20 version
# Author:    Newton Costa
# Repo:      github.com/NewtonCosta/k8s-upgrade-script
# Create on: 2021-03-26

# NOTE: The upgrade procedure on control plane nodes should be executed one node at a time. 
#       Pick a control plane node that you wish to upgrade first

# Global variables
NODE_NAME=${1:-$HOSTNAME}
KUBEADM_VERSION="1.20.2-00"

echo -e "Starting upgrade...\n"

# Draining control plane. Prepare the node for maintenance by marking it unschedulable and evicting the workloads
# You have to enter your node name as a parameter when invoking the script, otherwise it will use the value of HOSTNAME environment variable
echo -e "> Draining control plane \e[1m${NODE_NAME}\e[0m \n"
sudo kubectl drain ${NODE_NAME} --ignore-daemonsets
echo
#
# Upgrading Kubeadm and showing the new version
echo -e "> Upgrading kubeadm...\n"
sudo apt-mark unhold kubeadm && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y kubeadm=${KUBEADM_VERSION} && sudo apt-mark hold kubeadm
echo  "Upgraded to version: `sudo kubeadm version`"
echo
#
# Verifying upgrade plan
echo -e "> Checking upgrade plan...\n"
sudo kubeadm upgrade plan ${KUBEADM_VERSION}
#
# Applying the upgrade
echo -e "> Aplying the upgrade ignoring automatic certificate renewal...\n"
sudo kubeadm upgrade apply ${KUBEADM_VERSION} --certificate-renewal=false
#
# Upgrade kubelet and kubectl
echo -e "> Upgrading kubelet and kubectl\n"
sudo apt-mark unhold kubelet kubectl && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y kubelet=${KUBEADM_VERSION}  kubectl=${KUBEADM_VERSION}  && sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubectl
echo
#
# Restarting the kubelet
sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl restart kubelet
echo -e "daemon reloaded and kubelet restarted\n"
#
# Uncordoning the node
echo -e "> Bring the node back online by marking it schedulable...\n"
kubectl uncordon ${NODE_NAME}
echo
#
echo -e "Control plane ${HOSTNAME} \e[32msuccessfuly\e[0m upgraded"

```










**Note:** After upgrade procedure all containers are restarted, because the container spec hash value is changed.
